I see a lot of people using things like on the command line:

{% highlight bash %}
drush ev 'var_dump(\Drupal\user\Entity\User::load(1));'
{% endhighlight %}

<!--more-->

Aside from looking like crap, you need to type `drush ev ...` each time, remember to dump or print the output, escape quotes, and so on.

Or using The devel module's
`/devel/php` form. Which works OK, you could use `dpm()` for some nicer output. This approach also has downsides. A big one being that
you have to have devel enabled, and an execute PHP permission if you're not user 1. This would not be the best idea on a production system, 
for example.

There is a better way...

Since [Drush 7.0.0][drush-7-release] we now have a `drush php` command at our disposal. Let's use it! You can then use an interactive 
PHP [REPL][repl] (Currently [Boris][boris]) with your bootstrapped site, so you could run the same as above, but you don't need to print the output, 
it's evaluated for you. It's a Drupal code playground. You can do quick code experimentation, or just grab some data. This can
also help with debugging certain issues.

![Drush PHP user load][drush-php-1]

As you can see, you also get some easy on the eye colours, property visibility, and formatting. Courtesy of the Symfony [VarDumper][var-dumper] 
component. Much better than the standard PHP output.

You can also create your own local variables to (re)use in the REPL:

![Drush PHP serialize][drush-php-2]

In Drupal 8, you also get the service container added into the variable scope for you, so you don't need to do `\Drupal::getContainer()` or
`\Drupal::service('views.view_data')`. You can just do `$container->get('views.views_data')`.

Things are about to get a whole lot better too. Once this [pull request][drush-ops-psysh-pr] makes gets merged. [PsySH][psysh] is an even better 
PHP REPL. We can do even more great things like work with namespaces, autocompletion, and view documention or functions; to name a few. We will 
also have the ability to define custom commands for use in the shell! I will do a follow up post when we have made the switch to PsySH to show
all new power you'll have at your fingertips.
